# ML-Coursera-Pytorch

Reimplementation of the second course **"Advanced Learning Algorithms"** from Coursera's **Machine Learning Specialization** with Andrew Ng in PyTorch.
I tried to preserve original notebooks (optional labs), including their names.
All my code is commented + I also left text comments in the notebooks (usually, *in italics*).
